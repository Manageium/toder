## Getting Started

To customize this app, first clone this repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Manageium/toder.git
$ cd toder
```

Then install dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

Then start the API server:

```
$ npm start
```

Then, in a new terminal window run the following to start a hot-reloading dev server through webpack:

```
$ npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000/](localhost:8000) in your browser and you should see the app!

Make some changes and see what happens.
